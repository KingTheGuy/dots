> Don't do this blind, use something like penpot to draw out what i want first

## FIXME:

- [.] fix the freezing/crashing very annoying

- [ ] the player blinking is because it is a for loop
  - figure out another way to go about it

## TODO:

- [ ] volume/bars: should use an array.
    - instead of executing the command every time the user makes a change, instead have it run ever few ms and grab the last know.
    - or maybe not, this may make it feel slow??
- [ ] EQ menu should be within the Sinks menu with a button
- [ ] per source player (having just one kinda sucks)

- [ ] get source widget working

widgets to add:

- [ ] network
- [ ] workspace indicator
- [ ] weather
- [ ] notifications indicator (if i missed anything)
- [ ] power menu (poweroff,restart,logout)
- [ ] battery indicator (use a progress_bar. onclick open then power menu.. change the icon color depending the battery start.no battery color stays default)
- [ ] stats, also add storage usage
